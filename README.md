What does this group do when two or more members disagree (ex. on a technical approach, a technology choice, etc)?
Do you vote? Does the whole group get involved? Do you get someone else to decide?

--We will put the request to a vote. //Eric will be tie-breaker(if possible)

What does this group do when a member is frustrated?
What strategy do you use to talk about it? What do you do if you're the frustrated person? What do you do if you're the person someone is frustrated with? Imagine a situation where Person A thinks that Person B is not pulling their weight - write a script for how you think that conversation should go.

How do we pair? What do we do when two group members pair with each other?

How does this group approach work "after hours" (i.e. after normal class hours and weekends)?
Is it okay to work on your own after hours? How do we keep the group informed? Do we only work after hours when we can pair? When the entire group is present?
